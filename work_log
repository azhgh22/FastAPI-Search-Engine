1. 20/02 19:00 : Did set up Env. Started builing FastAPI interface. Thinking about Project architecture, which enables me to change different parts of the program and test them easily.

2. 20/02 21:00 : Built architecture of project, trying to follow SOLID principles to simplify my future work. after that, I will try different search engine methodologies and choose the best.

3. 21/02 18:00 : After learning Vector Search, add VectorSearchEngine. It uses pretrained all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model to transform text into embedings and search similar texts using similarity scores between vectors. Confused about: In what format should I pass user input to the model to generate embedings. currently I am encoding products in this format: f"{p.name} {p.description} {p.brand}"

4. 21/02 20:00:  add Exact search API. filter by name, price, description. add sqllite db, instead of inmemory db. Comfused About:
    Vector search model I implemented, underlines semantics like material and type of product more, and has payed negligible attention to semantics like country it was produced in.
